ModLoader Manual
=========================

Never having to edit meta.xml, never being too lazy to add new mods, no problems with custom handlings, and working vehicle collisions. That's exactly what this resource does for you. You can't get it any simplet than this. Isn't that great?

Installation
------------

First of all, download modloader from *here*. Make sure to **unzip** the downloaded package into your resources directory of MTA, else ModLoader will **not** work. It's also adviced you rename the resource afterwards, for example to modloader-my_suffix. By doing this you will make sure that people dont have to redownload all the mods when they have visited another server running ModLoader under the same name.

After you've done that, you **must** give ModLoader access to the restartResource function. The easiest way to do this is by adding `<object name="resource.modloader-my_suffix"></object>` under the admin group in _acl.xml_.

Installing mods
---------------

Installing modifications has never been this easy. All you've got to do is find your favorite vehicle, weapon or skin mods on your preferred source, place them in the correct folders and you're all set. [GTAInside][3] and [GTAGarage][4] are popular sources for mods.

After you've downloaded a mod, you take the TXD and DFF and place them in the desired folder. These files **must** have the name of the GTA harcoded name. **qais pls**
